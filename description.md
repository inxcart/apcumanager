The official thirty bees APCu cache allows you to monitor and clear your site's ACPu cache from the back office.

APCu cache is a caching mechanism for caching user entered data in memory, speeding your site up for users that are logged in. This cache works inconjunction with our full page caching system to deliver excellent performance.

This module does not install any type of cache, it only allows you to monitor the cache on your server if it is installed in PHP already.
